# README: Math Expr Evaluator

### Brief:
An arithmetic expression evaluator written in C++. It uses a recursive descent parser & AST approach for basic syntax checking and later support for additional syntax if needed.

### Some extras:
 - I must add parenthesis support!
 - I should add a REPL for expressions.
